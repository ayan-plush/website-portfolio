      Hello ! I'm Ayan,<br></br> and I'm a third-year software engineering student at Delhi Technological University with a passion for technology, art, and literature.<br></br><br></br>
      Growing up, I was captivated by developers who could create immersive user experiences and elegant code that seamlessly commanded users' attention and engagement.<br></br> I dreamt of presenting to an audience something that is bizarre, yet impeccably beautiful and innovative.
      This passion later developed into my love for being able to create captivating and mesmerizing websites.<br></br><br></br>
