      Hello ! I'm Ayan,<br></br> and I'm a second-year software engineering student at Delhi Technological University with a passion for technology, art, and literature.<br></br><br></br>
      Growing up, I was fascinated by artists and how they are able to captivate their audience's attention with ease.<br></br> I dreamt of presenting to an audience something that is bizarre, yet impeccably beautiful and innovative.
      This passion later developed into my love for digital-art and being able to create captivating and mesmerizing websites.<br></br><br></br>
      I love to read and practice my problem solving skills on leetcode. I'm currently an associate at my university's Queer collective, we aim
      to foster an inclusive space and encourage LGBTQIA+ voices in STEM.
